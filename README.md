## üéØ Introduction

Drivesafe is a cutting-edge application designed to combat drowsiness and distracted driving using modern machine learning techniques. It emphasizes the integration of PyTorch with Apple's Core ML. Leveraging the power of the YOLOv8 object detection model, DriveSafe is meticulously trained on a distinctive dataset that amalgamates records from FORM and YawDD datasets. Its core mission is to detect drowsiness in real-time, fostering safer driving experiences.

## üìú Dataset Details

- **Base Dataset**: [FORM Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/6695771)
- **Additional Dataset**: [YawDD](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/yawdd-yawning-detection-dataset)

After fusing and manually annotating data from the mentioned sources, the comprehensive [DRIVESAFE Dataset](https://app.roboflow.com/damian-lab/drivesafe/overview) emerges. With Roboflow's assistance, 780 images were annotated. Further preprocessing enhancements, including brightness adjustments and blur effects for data augmentation, expanded the dataset to a grand total of 1886 images.

## üöÄ Model Information

DriveSafe is empowered by the [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) model, a renowned member of the YOLO family of object detection models developed using PyTorch. These models excel at detecting facial features in individual images, presenting bounding box predictions, classifications, and the accompanying confidence scores.

## üõ† Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **Development Environment**: Xcode

## üåü Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the Model:

Start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renzodamgo/ios-ObjectDetection-YOLO.git
````
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the App:

Post-cloning, head to the root of the ObjectDetection-CoreML directory and introduce the project with:
```bash
open ObjectDetection-CoreML.xcodeproj
```

## Features and Workflow

DriveSafe boasts a set of features ensuring the driver's safety:

1. YOLOv8 Object Detection: Identifies:
  - Eyes (Open or Closed)
  - Head's orientation
  - Yawning

2. Alarm System: Alerts the driver based on real-time insights:
  - Not looking ahead for over 4 seconds
  - Eyes shut for more than 500 ms
  - Yawning exceeding 2 seconds

3. Audit Log: Retains a log when alarms are triggered, offering insights into potential patterns of distraction or drowsiness.

For installation, ensure the smartphone camera is properly placed on the dashboard behind the steering wheel, capturing the driver's face without any blockages.

DriveSafe's workflow involves:

1. Streaming video data from the camera to the YOLOv8 model.
2. Detecting and categorizing facial aspects.
3. Using Boolean logic to deduce driver's state based on the recognized features.
4. Activating relevant alarms based on the observations.
